Adjacent    - Lesson 1: Evolution and innovation usually happen in the realm of the adjacent possible.
Hunches     - Lesson 2: Greate ideas generally evolve over time as slow hunches rather than sudden breakthroughs
Platforms   - Lesson 3: Platforms are like springboards for innovations
            - Lesson 4: Innovation and evolution thrive in large networks.
            - Lesson 5: Collaboration is at least as important a driver of innovation as competition.
Serendipity - Lesson 6: Lucky connections between ideas drive innovation.
  Space      - Lesson 7: Serendipitous discoveries can be facilitated by a shared intellectual or physical space.
Error       - Lesson 8: Great innovations emerge from environments that are partly contaminated by error.
Repurpose   - Lesson 9: Innovation thrives on reinventing and reusing the old.
