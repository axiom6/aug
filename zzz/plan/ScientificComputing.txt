    recognizing complex problems
    adequately conceptualising the system containing these problems
    designing a framework of algorithms suitable for studying this system: the simulation
    choosing a suitable computing infrastructure
      (parallel computing/grid computing/supercomputers)
    hereby, maximising the computational power of the simulation
    assessing to what level the output of the simulation resembles the systems:
       the model is validated
    adjusting the conceptualisation of the system accordingly
    repeating cycle until a suitable level of validation is obtained:
       the computational scientists trusts that the simulation generates
       adequately realistic results for the system,
       under the studied conditions
